## Part 1
#### Manage source code using version control (10 points)

In this assignment, you will create a local `Git` repository for your solution, and commit your changes regularly as you complete Part 2 and Part 3 of this assignment. Typically, your commit history should show at least 10 commits, outlining the steps you took to create these projects.

**Requirements:**

At the end of Part 2 and Part 3 of this assignment, submit a single zip file containing your solution folder.
Your solution folder should contain two projects: one resulting from Part 2 and the other resulting from Part 3.
Make sure your zip file contains the entire `Git` repository.

## Part 2
#### Create a basic `C#` console application (15 points)

In Visual Studio, create a new project using the Console App template. Name your project `FirstConsoleApplication`. This project will be part of a new solution, which will contain two projects from Part 2 and Part 3 of this assignment. Name your solution `FirstSolution`.

**Requirements:**

This console application will prompt the user for two numbers and an operation (addition, subtraction, or multiplication).
The program will output the result of performing the selected operation on the two numbers to the console.

## Part 3
#### Create a basic `C#` Windows forms application (15 points)

In Visual Studio, under your solution called `FirstSolution`, create a new project using the Windows Forms App template and name it `FirstFormsApplication`. For this part of the assignment, you will create a Windows forms application that will implement the same functionality you implemented in your console application in Part 2 in a visual manner.

**Requirements:**

Your form should contain three textboxes, a button and a label. Two of the textboxes will be used to enter numbers, and the third will be used to enter an operation to perform (addition, subtraction, or multiplication).
The program will output the result of performing the selected operation on the two numbers to the label.
