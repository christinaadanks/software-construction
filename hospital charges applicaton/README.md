# Hospital Charges

Create an application that calculates the total cost of a hospital stay. The daily base charge is $350. The hospital also charges for medication, surgical fees, lab fees, and physical rehab. The application should accept the following input:

* The number of days spent in the hospital
* The amount of medication charges
* The amount of surgical charges
* The amount of lab fees
* The amount of physical rehabilitation charges

Create and use the following value-returning methods in the application:

* `CalcStayCharges` — calculates and returns the base charges for the hospital stay. This is computed as $350 times the number of days in the hospital.
* `CalcMiscCharges` —calculates and returns the total of the medication, surgical, lab, and physical rehabilitation charges.
* `CalcTotalCharges` —calculates and returns the total charges.
